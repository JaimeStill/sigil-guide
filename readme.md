## Guide

The following section is just a guide that's helpful for me. It should not limit or cause conflict with the way you perceive planetary or elemental energies. One thing magick has taught me is that this journey is highly personal, and it is important to find what works for you.

Elemental interactions:

* If they are the same suit, they **strengthen** each other
* Fire and Air are active, they **support** each other
* Water and Earth are passive, they **support** each other
* Fire and Water are enemies, they **weaken** each other
* Air and Earth are enemies, they **weaken** each other
* Fire and Earth are **neutral** to each other
* Water and Air are **neutral** to each other

There are 4 different types of relationships, which break down into the following:

* **Strengthen**: Increases the intensity of the elements. It amplifies both their positive and negative qualities.
* **Support**: These elements have a collaborative relationship. They build one another up.
* **Weaken**: These element cancel each other out. They decrease the effectiveness of each element.
* **Neutral**: They don't affect one another.
